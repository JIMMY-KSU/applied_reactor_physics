# NE 620/860 – Applied Reactor Physics

## Basic Information

**Instructor**: Dr. Jeremy Roberts

**Meeting**: 3--4pm Thursdays in Ward 135

**Informal Laboratories**: 2:30--4pm Mondays and Wednesdays in Ward 133 or the Ward Hall computer lab.

## Description

This course surveys the flow of modern reactor physics analyses, beginning with the processing of evaluated nuclear data and ending with the use of few-group, cross-section data in full-core reactor modeling based on diffusion theory. Additionally, components of reactor core design will be considered, focusing on the use of a simple computational model to illustrate key concepts. All theoretical aspects of the course will be reinforced by a number of application-oriented “laboratories” that include the design of a BWR fuel assembly and the optimization of a PWR core.

## Objectives 

Students will understand the basic flow of practical reactor physics calculations and how to perform such calculations with a variety of standard tools.

## Prerequisites 

NE 630 – Reactory Theory (or equivalent) and ME 400 – Computer Applications in ME (or equivalent). Some assignments will require programming, and others will be made much easier with programming.

## Textbook

Students should have a textbook from a past reactor theory class. If not, Nuclear Reactor Physics by Lewis, Nuclear Reactor Analysis by Duderstadt and Hamilton, and Neutron Physics by Reuss are good resources (listed in increasing order of completeness).  The serious reactor physics student should have these.  More advanced resources include *Methods of Steady-state Reactor Physics in Nuclear Design* by Stammler and Abbate and *Applied Reactor Physics* by Hebert. When needed, students will be provided supplementary material from these and other resources. In addition, the software packages to be used in this course also come with supporting documentation.

## Outcomes

- Use standard software (e.g., NJOY) to process nuclear data and to produce multigroup cross sections.
- Use commercial-grade software (e.g., CASMO-4) to perform various lattice-level calculations on university machines (i.e., students will not need the software on their machines).
- Explain how the output of lattice-level calculations (e.g., few-group diffusion parameters) are used in various downstream analyses (e.g., full core reactor models).
- Explain how fuel reactivity changes as a function of geometry, composition, and reactor conditions, using the classical four-factor formula to help build intuition.
- Use lattice-level calculations together with linear-reactivity models or commercial-grade, nodal-diffusion tools (e.g., SIMULATE-3) to analyze a PWR core configuration, including the determination of reactivity coefficients, power peaking factors, and cycle length.

## Course Organization

The course is broadly organized in 5 distinct units (or "modules") with one formal lecture per week.  This lecture will be a mixture of theory and practice (e.g., writing input, running codes, and viewing output).  Informal laboratories will be held twice per week during my normal office hours.  These are times when you can count on me being available for questions, but it will not be a directed laboratory session.

## Course Assessment

Each module will culminate in a computational laboratory assignment that will be performed in groups of two (or, if an odd number of students, three).  A formal laboratory report must be written in a pre-determined format (likely, the two-column, ANS Transaction format).  At my request, any and all code input, raw output, scripts, and other materials must be made available.  For all laboratories, teams should include at least one graduate and one undergraduate student.

Students earning graduate credit will also be assigned a literature review.  Students will be assigned one or more papers representative of a specific topic. Students must then dive into the literature and produce an annotated bibliography of the literature, with a 1 to 2 page summary, and defend their review during a 30-minute oral examination.

Overall grading: 20% per laboratory for undergraduates; for graduates, 18% per laboratory and 10% for the review.
